molasse library
===============

TODO: Name of this file should be README, must rename.

optimizationoptions: bunch of switches to change the behavior
	of the library

molasseexception: all exceptions thrown by this library are 
	supposed to be MolasseException

datacube: stupid but hopefully bug-free implementation of a
	data cube as just a big array with no fancy features

ramcube: even stupider RAM-only cube (for faster debugging)

chunkeddatacube: meant to be a somewhat more realistic data cube

python_datacube: wrapper class which utilizes the Boost libraries for any Python <-> C++
	conversions that are needed.
