 Benchmarking tool for the Ola algorithm 
 Build: Jul  8 2004 16:30:50
 Times are user; ensure no significant system times
 Benchmarks can take a long time to compute 
 Values are always given as pairs init time + total operation time 
Starting benchmarking from hellifax 
Testing obvious no-precomputation algorithm, full data
time for  100 naive rangesums
data size is 1073741825
 == Slow Range Sums === virtual array of size 1073741825
 [srs] Computations took 0.008894 NOTE: units are megaseconds!!
 For 100 range sums 
 average was -0.0737617    
0,0.008894
Done with benchmarking from hellifax.
