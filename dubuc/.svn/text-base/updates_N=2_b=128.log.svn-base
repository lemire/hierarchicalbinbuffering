./benchmark
 Benchmarking tool for the Ola algorithm 
 Build: Jul  5 2004 22:27:31
 Benchmarks can take a long time to compute 
 Values are always given as pairs init time + total operation time 
Starting benchmarking from hellifax 
Testing incremental updates with typical N and b
 size = 1073741825 b=128,beta=4
 external array is : 4 GB
 bin arrays are : 0.5 KB
N (aka M and M' in paper) is 2
update time for  2000 updates
 == Updates === virtual array of size 1073741825 N = 2 b = 128
 It took 2774.95 s to build a buffer of size 8388609
 beta (number of levels) = 4
 [update] Computations took 2.51
 For 2000 range sums 
update time for  200000 updates
 == Updates === virtual array of size 1073741825 N = 2 b = 128
 It took 2758.68 s to build a buffer of size 8388609
 beta (number of levels) = 4
 [update] Computations took 61.17
