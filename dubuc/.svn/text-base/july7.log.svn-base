TAKEN SINGLE USER EXTERNAL ARRAY on KASER

 Benchmarking tool for the Ola algorithm 
 Build: Jul  7 2004 08:18:54
 Times are WALL CLOCK
 Benchmarks can take a long time to compute 
 Values are always given as pairs init time + total operation time 
Starting benchmarking from hellifax 
Testing obvious no-precomputation algorithm, smaller data
update time for  20 naive rangesums
data size is 268435457
 == Slow Range Sums === virtual array of size 268435457
 [srs] Computations took 0.000159
 For 20 range sums 
 average was -0.245651
0,0.000159
Done with benchmarking from hellifax.
